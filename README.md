# helloworld-python
Designated for the hello wolrd project I'll be doing in Python for MLH-LHD: Build '21
Updating this file so that I can make and merge a pull request, to satisfy one of the MLH-LHD: Build hackathon challenges for Day 1, which is almost done, so I'm being a little daft here... Serious changes/requests to come soon though, for the real project completion.
